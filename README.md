# PREDICTING-THE-STOCK-PRICE-OF-COMPANIES-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS
# ABSTRACT
The stock exchange is a financial market in which stocks and bonds of listed companies are
traded. These companies are generally large firms that have real power over the national, and
even international, economy. Having a glimpse into the future of the markets and capturing
the stock market trend is therefore interesting, even fundamental, for certain trades such as
traders who have to make decisions quickly and efficiently. The analysis of stock market
activities and more particularly the prediction of stock prices is a problem that has attracted
the interest of the scientific community, in which statistics, economics and data scientists
have taken an interest. Predicting stock prices is a time series problem since past stock price
values are numeric values that represent the change in the stock price over time. The dataset
here, that we have obtained from Yahoo Finance, is a sample of the historical data of the
stocks of some companies in which we use to predict the future values.
